# Panda-Co-Manipulation-Dataset
### A dataset of Franka Emika Panda recordings of 2D symbols.

Welcome to the **Panda Co-Manipulation Dataset** page! <br>
This is a public available dataset and comprises of 21 different 2D symbols. Each symbol was printed in A4 format, then traced back with the help of a Franka Emika Panda robot, equipped with a Schunk FT-AXIA force/torque sensor. <br>
Six recordings were made for each symbols, by fixing the start and end point to be always the same. In the provided __files.pdf__ related to the symbols, start and end points are represented, respectively, by a circle and an asterisk.

A key feature of the dataset is that symbol's recordings of the same group do not differ in path, but instead vary significantly in time, including speed variations and pauses. <br>
The recordings are provided both as MATLAB and Python structures in every symbol folder, named respectively as __symbol_data.mat__ and __symbol_data.npy__ . The structure is the following: <br>
<br>
> symbol_data: structure of 6 elements with fields <br>
> --- symbol_data[i].pos : end-effector position recordings [3xT] <br>
> --- symbol_data[i].vel : end-effector velocity recordings [3xT] <br>
> --- symbol_data[i].F : end-effector force recordings [3xT] <br>
<br>
where T defines the number of samples for each recording.


Load **MATLAB** file example:
```matlab
load('symbol_data.mat');
i = 2; % 2nd recording
pos = symbol_data(i).pos;
vel = symbol_data(i).vel;
F   = symbol_data(i).F;
```
Load **Python** file example:
```python
import numpy as np
symbol_data = np.load('symbol_data.npy')
i = 2 # 2nd recording
pos = symbol_data[i]['pos']
vel = symbol_data[i]['vel']
F   = symbol_data[i]['F']
```

The Panda Co-Manipulation Dataset was introducted as part of the paper entitled **Robot Skills Synthesis from Multiple Demonstration via Spatial Sampling** by __G.Braglia, D.Tebaldi, A.E.Lazzaretti and L.Biagiotti__, from University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and Federal Technological University of Paran√†. <br>
