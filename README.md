# Panda-Co-Manipulation-Dataset
### A dataset of Franka Emika Panda recordings of 2D symbols.


Welcome to the **Panda Co-Manipulation Dataset** page! <br>
This is a public available dataset and comprises of 21 different 2D symbols. Each symbol was printed in A4 format, then traced back with the help of a Franka Emika Panda robot, equipped with a Schunk FT-AXIA force/torque sensor. <br>
Six recordings were made for each symbols, by fixing the start and end point to be always the same. In the provided __files.pdf__ related to the symbols, start and end points are represented, respectively, by a circle and an asterisk.


A key feature of the dataset is that symbol's recordings of the same group do not differ in path, but instead vary significantly in time, including speed variations and pauses.
